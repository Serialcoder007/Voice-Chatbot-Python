# Voice Chatbot in Python (PyCharm preferred)
This is a simple voice chatbot implemented in Python using the power of speech recognition and natural language processing. It allows users to interact with the chatbot by speaking their commands and receiving responses in real-time.

## Features
1. Voice Recognition: The chatbot utilizes speech recognition to convert spoken language into text, enabling users to communicate with the bot using their voice.
Natural Language Processing: By employing natural language processing techniques, the chatbot can understand and interpret user input, providing meaningful responses.
2. Real-time Interaction: The chatbot engages in a live conversation with the user, responding immediately to their spoken commands.
Customizable Responses: You can easily customize the chatbot's responses by modifying the underlying code, enabling it to provide specific information or perform desired tasks.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

1. Python 3.x
2. SpeechRecognition library: pip install SpeechRecognition
3. PyAudio library: pip install pyaudio (Windows users might require additional setup steps)
4. pyttsx3 library: pip install pyttsx3

## Usage
- Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
- Install the required dependencies.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
- Run the chatbot.py file using the command: python chatbot.py.
- The chatbot will train and initialize and wait for your spoken commands.
- Start speaking your command after the beep sound, and the chatbot will process and respond to it accordingly.

## Customization
To customize the chatbot's responses or add more functionalities, you can modify the voice_chatbot.py file. The code contains comments explaining each section, making it easy for you to understand and make the desired changes.
